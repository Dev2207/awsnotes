AWS Dynamo DB Notes:

- Data are stored in SDD
- Automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones within an AWS Region. 
- Partition management is handled entirely by DynamoDBâ€”you never have to manage partitions yourself.
- Primary key = Partition key
- Works  internaly with the help of continous hashing
- build tables where the partition key element has a large number of distinct values
- Query based on P.Key is faster bcoz dynamo will know which node/host to search for
- Scan is costly, bcoz dynamo db doesnt know the data location. Its a brute force search.
- Also Scanning is costly since aws charges for all read items.
- Partition can store 10 GB of data.
- WCU/RCU are equally distributed among nodes.
- Strong consistent reads are 1 RCU (No stale Data)and Eventual consistent reads are 0.5 RCU(Stale Data possible).
- LSI gives a flexiblity of additional sort keys.
- In LSI values can be duplicated.
- All LSI data of same partition can be of 10GB size.
- GSI gives a flexiblity of additional partition keys . Copy of the same data with different partition key.
- 5 LSI and 5 GSI are allowed per table.
- LSI max 10Gb whereas GSI unlimited size.
- Consistent reads are not allowed in GSI.
- 1 RCU = 4KiloBytes/second, 1 WCU : Put/Delete = 1KiloByte/second, Update = max(olditem,new item)/1KiloBytes.
- Max rcu = 10,000 can extend upto 20,000 per table, likewise wcu.
- First 25GB data free, $0.25 thereafter.
- DynamoDB version attribute is used for optimistic locking.
- Clobber Save Behaviour - to override the locking,

Scenario: If a table has 40 attributes and each attribute constitute 1Kb data. When my appln tries to read only 4 attributes, how 
much read capacity units im consuming? 40/4 = 10 RCU.
